# 🪨 Rock-Paper-Scissors (Console Game)

A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using **HTML** and **JavaScript**, playable directly in the browser console.

Test your luck against the computer — can you outsmart it and win the game?

## 🧠 How It Works

- The game prompts the player to choose between `"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`.
- The computer randomly selects its move.
- The result (win/lose/draw) is displayed in the browser **console**.
- The game can be played as many times as you like by refreshing the page or re-running the function.
